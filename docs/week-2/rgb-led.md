# The RGB LED

<LessonMeta {...frontMatter} />

An RGB (Red-Green-Blue) LED is is like 3 LEDs in one. We can use an RGB LED to produce a variety of colors by mixing different intensities of red, green and blue light. Search up `RGB LED` online to understand what one looks like.

## How it works

An RGB LED has 4 pins - one for each color (R, G, B) and a common pin. The common pin is the longest pin on your RGB LED and goes to `GND` or `5V` depending on whether you have a common cathode or common anode RGB LED. 

We'll assume you're using a common cathode RGB LED for this lesson, and we'll connect the common pin to `GND`. If you have a common anode RGB LED, just connect the common pin to `5V` instead.

## Constructing your circuit

Components required:
- 1x RGB LED 
- 3x 220Î© resistor
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires
- Your Arduino Uno

## Programming your RGB LED

Now that you've wired up your RGB LED, it's time to program it to blink. Each color pin (R, G, B) behaves just like a regular LED, and you can turn it on and off by sending a `HIGH` or `LOW` signal. For example, the sketch below can be used to cycle through red, green and blue every second. 

```cpp
int redPin = 9;
int greenPin = 10;
int bluePin = 11;
 
void setup() {
  pinMode(redPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(greenPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(bluePin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(redPin, HIGH);   // Red on
  digitalWrite(greenPin, LOW);
  digitalWrite(bluePin, LOW);
  delay(1000);

  digitalWrite(redPin, LOW);
  digitalWrite(greenPin, HIGH); // Green on
  digitalWrite(bluePin, LOW);
  delay(1000);

  digitalWrite(redPin, LOW);
  digitalWrite(greenPin, LOW);
  digitalWrite(bluePin, HIGH);  // Blue on
  delay(1000);
}
```

## Mixing colors

Alternatively, since we've connected our color pins to pins that support PWM, we can use these to send a PWM signal and vary the brightness of each color. This can then be used to mix colors.

    Pick your favorite color using [this RGB color picker](https://www.rapidtables.com/web/color/RGB_Color.html). Note down the R, G, B values and use the `analogWrite()` function to mix colors to obtain your favorite!

    This is an example sketch to display the color `Turquoise`. 
    ```cpp
    int redPin = 9;
    int greenPin = 10;
    int bluePin = 11;

    void setup() {
        pinMode(redPin, OUTPUT);
        pinMode(greenPin, OUTPUT);
        pinMode(bluePin, OUTPUT);
    }

    void loop() {
        analogWrite(redPin, 64);
        analogWrite(greenPin, 224);
        analogWrite(bluePin, 208);
    }
    ```

## Assignment 

:::info Your Turn
1. Write a program to make your RGB LED cycle through different colors. Choose three colors of your choice and make each of them fade in and out slowly, one after the other. Remember to use the `delay()` function.
